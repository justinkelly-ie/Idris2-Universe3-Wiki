# 📦 Chapter 1: Discrete Box Algebra & Contour Geometry

In classical continuous physics, physical space and field values are modeled using continuous real manifolds ($\mathbb{R}^n$). However, real numbers introduce non-constructive limits, uncountable infinities, and floating-point rounding errors. 

In this framework, physical state space is constructed entirely from **discrete integer multisets** (known as *Pixel Boxes*) and **rational geometric metrics**, eliminating continuum paradoxes at first principles.

## 1. Mathematical Foundations of Norman Wildberger's Box Arithmetic

Physical state space is constructed constructivally using **Norman Wildberger's Finitist Box Arithmetic** (*Math Foundations* 02/03). Rather than assuming continuous real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) or wave-function continuum limits, natural numbers and physical quantities are derived from nested multisets of empty boxes:

\[
\text{[]}=0, \quad \text{[[]]}=1, \quad \text{[[] []]}=2, \quad \text{[[] [] []]}=3, \dots
\]

A **Box** of type $a$ (denoted `Box a`) is a finite multiset represented as a balanced tree of key-density pairs $[(k_i, v_i)]$, where $k_i$ represents a discrete key/state and $v_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ represents the integer count or density at that key.

Signed integer quantities (such as particle charges, quadrances, or metric entries) are wrapped in `BoxInt` structures:

\[
\text{BoxInt} \equiv \text{MkBoxInt}(v), \quad v \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

Exact rational proportions across discrete grid cells are parameterized by **Unixel Fractions** ($p/q \in \mathbb{Q}_{>0}$):

\[
\text{UnixelFraction} \equiv \frac{p}{q}, \quad p, q \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}
\]

Two unixel fractions $f_1 = p_1/q_1$ and $f_2 = p_2/q_2$ are proved equivalent via exact cross-multiplication:

\[
f_1 \sim f_2 \iff p_1 \cdot q_2 = p_2 \cdot q_1
\]

## 2. Canonical Dyck Contour Walks & Narayana Combinatorics

Every discrete multiset tree configuration (`BoxSpec`) maps bijectively to a **canonical non-negative Dyck contour walk** on a $2D$ integer lattice (Wildberger *MathFoundations 105* / Catalan $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$):

- **Up-steps** (`True` / $+1$) correspond to open brackets $[$ and descent into a sub-box (key insertion and density accumulation).
- **Down-steps** (`False` / $-1$) correspond to close brackets $]$ and ascent out of a sub-box (density removal or scale jump).
- **Narayana Refinement**: The Narayana numbers $N(n, k) = \frac{1}{n} \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{k-1}$ index Dyck paths by peak count $k$, structuring the 4 metric sectors:
  - **Elliptic** ($\det g = +1$, 27 Bound-State VM)
  - **Hyperbolic** ($\det g = -1$, 128 Gauge-Flux DE)
  - **Parabolic** ($\det g = 0$, 55 Dissipation DM)
  - **Substrate** ($g_{22} = 0, g_{12} = 1$, Primorial 210 Ground State)
- **Holographic Boundary Transmission**: Dyck paths act as prefix-free boundary bitstreams for Law 13 (Holographic Bound) and Law 21 (Unitary Hawking Radiation Evaporation).
- **Spread Metric** ($S$): Distance and geometric separation are computed strictly using rational quadrance $Q = \Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2$ and spread $S = Q / L^2$, avoiding trigonometric approximations.

## 3. Executable Literate Verification

The following literate Idris 2 module verifies the fundamental algebraic laws of Box Arithmetic:

```idris
module Foundations.Discrete_Box_Algebra_and_Contour_Geometry

import Core.BoxInt
import Core.Multiset
import Core.UnixelFraction
import Core.VexelMaxel

%default total

||| Verifies that the empty multiset acts as an exact additive identity 
||| for multiset union: b ∪ ∅ = b.
public export
proof_box_additive_identity : Box Nat -> Bool
proof_box_additive_identity b = unionBox b emptyBox == b

||| Verifies exact integer multiplication on BoxInt values without precision loss:
||| (3) * (7) = 21.
public export
proof_box_scaling : BoxInt
proof_box_scaling = (intToBoxInt 3) * (intToBoxInt 7)

||| Verifies cross-multiplication equivalence for rational UnixelFractions:
||| (1/1) ~ (2/2) because 1 * 2 = 1 * 2.
public export
proof_unixel_equiv : Bool
proof_unixel_equiv = rationalEquiv unitUnixelFraction (mkUnixelFraction 2 2)
```

### Contextual Explanation of Code Assertions:
1. `proof_box_additive_identity`: Evaluates `unionBox b emptyBox`. Since multiset union accumulates counts across keys, unioning with `emptyBox` leaves all key-density pairs unchanged, returning `True`.
2. `proof_box_scaling`: Demonstrates `Num BoxInt` instance multiplication `3 * 7`, producing `MkBoxInt 21` with exact integer semantics.
3. `proof_unixel_equiv`: Evaluates `rationalEquiv` between $1/1$ and $2/2$. Cross-multiplication yields $1 \times 2 = 1 \times 2$, returning `True` at compile time.
