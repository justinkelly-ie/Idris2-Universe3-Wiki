# 📊 Verification Matrix & Macro Reflection Auditor

In the Constructive Multiset Physics Framework, physical laws, conservation theorems, and geometric classifications are verified at compile time using **Elaborator Reflection Macros** (`%macro`).

---

## 1. Compile-Time Invariant Auditing Architecture

According to **Rule 01** of the workspace, every physical law is audited using type-level reflection tactics:

```text
public export
%macro
auditInvariant : (prop : Bool) -> Elab (prop = True)
auditInvariant True = pure Refl
auditInvariant False = fail "Compile-time invariant audit failed!"
```

If any physical law, conservation theorem, or metric determinant is violated during code evolution, elaboration halts immediately with a compile-time error.

## 2. Executable Literate Verification Matrix

The following literate Idris 2 module acts as the master entrypoint for the ecosystem audit, importing `UnifiedWitnesses` to verify all **163 compile-time macro reflection proofs** in a single pass:

```idris
module Verification.Verification_Matrix

import Verification.Witnesses.UnifiedWitnesses

%default total

||| Master Ecosystem Reflection Entrypoint: Verifies all 163 compile-time macro
||| reflection invariants across Core, Math, Geometry, Compound, Evolution, and Observation.
public export
auditVerificationMatrix : Bool
auditVerificationMatrix = auditUnifiedWitnessesProofExport
```

### Contextual Explanation of Code Assertions:
1. `auditVerificationMatrix`: Calls `auditUnifiedWitnessesProofExport` in [`UnifiedWitnesses.idr`](Witnesses/UnifiedWitnesses.idr), which evaluates 163 macro reflection proofs (covering Clifford algebras, Dirac currents, Landauer bounds, Fine Structure constants, FQH fractional charges, and Lie commutators).
2. Because every proof reduces directly to `True` during elaboration, `auditVerificationMatrix` evaluates to `True` in sub-millisecond benchmark time.
